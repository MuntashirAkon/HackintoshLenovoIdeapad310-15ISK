# HackintoshLenovoIdeapad310-15ISK
My attempts to install macOS on Lenovo Ideapad 310 15ISK (i5-6200U, Intel HD520)

#### Currently not working
- 32-bit color (proper EDID inject may be needed)
- HDMI (proper patching is required)
- WiFi (Need to replace PCI card, currently using external)
- Card Reader (Will never work)
- Trackpad (detected as mouse)
- Brightness keys (currently `Fn+P` and `Fn+C`)

#### Applied DSDT Patches
- [bat] Lenovo Ideapad-Y700
- [sys] Skylake LPC
